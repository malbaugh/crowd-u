          <p>Violation of any of this Section 4 may result in the removal of some or all of your User Content (including User Profile Content, Solutions, Challenge Content and Submissions), disqualification from a Challenge, removal or reversal of some or all of your displayed actions taken on the Site, including but not limited to actions to follow another User, like User Content, and/or register for a Challenge or other event on the Site; and/or termination of your Crowd-U account at the sole discretion of Crowd-U and/or a Poster (where applicable).</p>
          <p>You acknowledge that we shall have the right (but not the obligation) in our sole discretion to pre-screen, refuse, or move any Content that is submitted to the Site. You agree that you must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the use of any Content, including any reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such Content.</p>
      
          <h2><strong> 5. PARTICIPATION IN A CHALLENGE </strong></h2>
          <p>Participation in a Challenge on our Site, including entering Submissions, is governed by this Agreement and the Official Rules posted on the Challenge Website. Official Rules are the responsibility of the Poster. If there is any inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement and the Official Rules of a Challenge, the Official Rules will prevail, but for that Challenge only.</p>
      
          <p><strong> A. Challenge Registration &amp; Submission</strong></p>
          <p>You must first create a Crowd-U account and register on the Challenge Website to be able to enter a Challenge. You need to follow all instructions stated on the Site in order to register.</p>
          <p><strong>(i) Challenge Submission Drafts &amp; Modifications</strong></p>
          <p>Prior to the end of a Submission Period, you may save draft versions of your Submission on the Site to your portfolio before submitting the Solutions to the Challenge for evaluation. Once the Submission Period has ended, you may not make any changes or alterations to your Submission, but you may continue to update the project in your portfolio.</p>
          <p>A Poster may permit you to modify part of your Submission after the Submission Period for the purpose of removing material that potentially infringes a third party mark or right, discloses personally identifiable information, or is otherwise inappropriate. The modified Submission must remain substantively the same as the original Submission with the only modification being what the Poster permits.</p>
          <p><strong>(ii) Team and Organization Representatives</strong></p>
          <p>If a team or organization is entering a Challenge, they must appoint and authorize one individual (the “Representative”) to represent, act, and enter a Submission, on their behalf. The Representative must meet the eligibility requirements for the Challenge specified in the Official Rules.</p>
          <p>By entering a Submission on the Site on behalf of a team or organization, you represent and warrant that you are the Representative authorized to act on behalf of your team or organization.</p>
          <p>If there is a dispute over the identity of a Participant in a Challenge on the Site, the email address used to enter the Challenge and the person or entity assigned to that email address will be used to determine the Participant. The Poster and Crowd-U are not responsible for resolving any dispute between individuals or entities over the identity of the Participant. In the event of such a dispute, they may disqualify the disputed Submission and/or suspend or withdraw a prize.</p>
          <p><strong>(iii) Responsibility for Challenge Submissions</strong></p>
          <p>You are solely responsible for confirming that your Submission is complete and for making and storing copies or drafts of it. The Poster is not responsible for confirming the accuracy or completeness of a Submission as received. The Poster and Crowd-U are not responsible for incomplete, late, misdirected, damaged, lost, illegible, or incomprehensible Submissions or for address or email address changes of the Participants or Representatives. Proof of sending or submitting will not be deemed to be proof of receipt by a Poster or Crowd-U.</p>
          <p>If Crowd-U and/or a Poster determines that your Submission has not been received, or has been erroneously deleted, lost, destroyed or corrupted, you may request the opportunity to resubmit your Submission. However, you must make such a request promptly after you know or should have known there was a problem. Your request will be handled at the sole discretion of the Poster and/or Crowd-U.</p>
      
      
          <p><strong> B. Determining Eligibility &amp; Display of Submissions</strong></p>
          <p>The Poster has the right to require additional information. They also have the right to access any software application that is part of your Submission, in person or via any other reasonable manner, to verify that the solution application functions and operates as described in other parts of your Submission, or to verify your role in creating the solution. Failure by a Participant to respond or provide the additional information or access may result in disqualification of the Submission by the Poster.</p>
          <p>Submissions may be posted on the Challenge Website or elsewhere on the Site before or after being screened or tested by the Poster for compliance with the Official Rules. Posting of a Submission to the Site or Challenge Website does not mean that the Submission is eligible. A Submission may be disqualified after it has been publically displayed.</p>
      
          <p><strong> C. Public Voting</strong></p>
          <p>Challenges on the Site may include public voting. Public voting for a Challenge will take place during a voting period specified on the Challenge Website. The Poster has the right to extend the voting period at any time for any reason.</p>
          <p>If public voting is used to determine winners, those winners will be selected based on the highest number of verified votes received on the Site during the voting period. Verified vote counts will be determined by Crowd-U and/or the Poster. If there is a tie between two or more Submissions, the winner will be determined by the Poster.</p>
          <p>Public voting is open to any person with a verified Crowd-U account. Each person is limited to one vote per Submission and may only vote using one account. Participants may not directly or indirectly offer or pay any monetary or other form of consideration in exchange for a vote.</p>
          <p>You may not use any manual or automated vote process or methods, or multiple e-mail addresses, to circumvent the one-vote limit per person per Submission. Doing so will subject all of your votes to disqualification. The Poster may also disqualify a Participant, if the Participant receives multiple or irregular votes from the same user or users, receives votes in a manner that indicates manual, automated or other vote manipulation, or attempts to compensate voters.</p>
          <p>If the voting process fails to operate properly or appears to be tampered with or tainted with errors, fraud or unfair practices, the Poster has the right to determine any public voting prize winners by using non-suspect votes, or by any other means they deem appropriate. If no alternative means of determining a public voting winner prize is available or selected, the Poster may terminate any prize related to public voting without designating a winner.</p>
          <p>The Poster and Crowd-U are not responsible for, and are not required to count any vote which, in their judgment, is incomplete, late, misdirected, damaged, unlawful or illicit. This includes votes secured in breach of the voting rules above, as well as those lost for technical reasons, or otherwise in violation of this Agreement or the Official Rules.</p>
      
          <p><strong> D. Entry Conditions</strong></p>
          <p>By entering a Challenge on the Challenge Website, you (and, if you are entering on behalf of a team or organization, each participating members) agree(s) to the following:</p>
          <p>(i) The relationship between you, the Participant, and the Poster and Crowd-U, is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other special relationship.</p>
          <p>(ii) You will be bound by and comply with this Agreement and the Official Rules and the decisions of the Poster, Crowd-U, and/or the Challenge judges which are binding and final in all matters relating to the Challenge.</p>
      
          <p><strong> E. Publicity</strong></p>
          <p>By participating in a Challenge on the Site you consent to the use of personal information about you, if you are a winner, by the Poster, Crowd-U, and third parties acting on their behalf. Such personal information includes, but is not limited to, your name, likeness, photograph, voice, opinions, comments and hometown and country of residence. It may be used in any existing or newly created media, worldwide without further payment or consideration or right of review, unless prohibited by law. Authorized use includes advertising and promotional purposes. The duration of your consent is for a period of three years following the conclusion of the Challenge. This consent applies, as applicable, to all members a Participant’s team or organization which participated in the winning Submission.</p>
      
          <p><strong> F. General Conditions applicable to Challenges</strong></p>
          <p>Posters and Crowd-U reserve the right, in their sole discretion, to cancel, suspend and/or modify a Challenge, or any part of it, in the event of a technical failure, fraud, or any other factor or event that was not anticipated or is not within their control.</p>
          <p>Posters and Crowd-U reserve the right in their sole discretion to disqualify any individual or Participant they find to be:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>actually, or presenting the appearance of, tampering with the entry process or the operation of a Challenge;</li>
          <li>acting in violation of this Agreement or the Official Rules, or in a manner that is inappropriate, unsportsmanlike, and/or not in the best interests of the Challenge; or</li>
          <li>violating any applicable law or regulation.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Any attempt by any person to undermine the proper conduct of a Challenge may be a violation of criminal and civil law. If a Poster or Crowd-U suspects that such an attempt has been made or is threatened, they may take appropriate action, including but not limited to requiring a Participant to cooperate with an investigation and referral to criminal and civil law enforcement authorities.</p>
          <p>If there is any discrepancy or inconsistency between the terms and conditions of the Official Rules and disclosures or other statements contained in any Challenge materials, including the Submission form, Challenge Website, advertising (including television, print, radio or online ads), the terms and conditions of the Official Rules shall prevail.</p>
          <p>The terms and conditions of Official Rules may change at any time, including the rights or obligations of the Participant and the Poster. The Poster will post the terms and conditions of the amended Official Rules on the Challenge Website.</p>
          <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, any amendment will become effective at the time specified in the posting of the amended Official Rules or, if no time is specified, the time of posting.</p>
          <p>If at any time prior to a Challenge deadline, a Participant or prospective Participant believes that any Official Rule is or may be unclear or ambiguous, they must submit a written request for clarification to the Poster.</p>
          <p>A Poster and/or Crowd-U's failure to enforce any term of this Agreement or the Official Rules shall not constitute a waiver of that provision. If any provision of any Official Rules is or becomes illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction whose laws or regulations apply to you, the remainder of the Official Rules, including the rule affected, shall remain unaffected and valid, to the fullest extent permitted by law, The illegal or unenforceable provision shall be replaced by a valid and enforceable provision that comes closest and best reflects the Poster’s intention in a legal and enforceable manner with respect to the invalid or unenforceable provision.</p>
      
          <p><strong> G. Challenge Disputes</strong></p>
          <p>By entering a Challenge on the Site, you agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law:</p>
          <p>(i) any and all disputes, claims and causes of action arising out of or connected with the Challenge, or any prizes awarded, other than those concerning the administration of the Challenge or the determination of winners, shall be resolved individually, without resort to any form of class action;</p>
          <p>(ii) any and all disputes, claims and causes of action arising out of or connected with the Challenge, or any prizes awarded, shall be resolved exclusively by the courts with jurisdiction at the Poster’s location, indicated in the Official Rules, and you consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts; and</p>
          <p>(iii) under no circumstances will you be entitled to, and you hereby waive all rights to claim, any punitive, incidental and consequential damages and any and all rights to have damages multiplied or otherwise increased.</p>
          <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitations or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above may not apply to you.</p>
          <p>All issues and questions concerning the construction, validity, interpretation and enforceability of a Challenge’s Official Rules, or the rights and obligations of you, the Participant, or the Poster in connection with the Challenge, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the country, province, state, and/or territory in which the Poster is located (as indicated in the Official Rules), without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law rules (whether of the Poster’s jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction), which would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the Poster’s jurisdiction.</p>
